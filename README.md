This project shows a simple webpage with information about me, a cute typing animation, a color palette, and some fun JavaScript animations. The page is styled with the Poppins font and a color palette that I generated using Adobe Color.

## Technical Achievements
- Styled the page with CSS, a custom font, and a pastel color palette.  
- Added rules for most elements on the page, including:  
  - `body` – sets the font family, background color, and text color  
  - `header` – background gradient, text color, padding, and border  
  - `h2` – color, padding, border-left  
  - `ul` – list style and padding  
  - `li` – margin  
  - `.computer` and `.screen` – styling for the typing animation container  
- Used JavaScript to add a **typing animation** that loops multiple lines of text.  
- Used a **fade-in/pulsing header animation** with JavaScript.  
- Used other semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<pre>`, `<footer>`.
